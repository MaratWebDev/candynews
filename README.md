Candy News
-----------

Candy News is mobile web application that allows the user to browse through a list of posts. It is responsive and built with HTML5, SCSS and jQuery. 

1. Created HTML structure with list of posts.

2. Styled it inline with [Candy Space] (http://www.candyspace.com/) website, used SASS.

3. For dragging and sorting posts I used [Touch Punch] (http://touchpunch.furf.com/) plug-in.

4. To create redirection to [Candy Space] (http://www.candyspace.com/) website from desktop view I used JAVASCRIPT redirection property.
